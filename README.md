Heart disease prediction using entropy based feature engineering and ensembling of machine learning classifiers <br>
Authors : Rajkamal Rajendran, Anitha Karthi

Highlights of this reseach work: <br>
A novel framework for heart disease detection is proposed. <br>
Handling categorical attributes based on its importance in health care and outcome. <br>
Covariance-based multivariate outlier detection is used for the outlier detection. <br>
Proposed Entropy-based FE (EFE) has performed well with ML models. <br>
The proposed ML pipeline outperformed the state of art works. <br>

Data Set: <br>
The heart disease dataset is curated by combining Cleveland, V A medical center, Hungarian and Switzerland databases over 14 common attributes. Imputing missing values (IMV) and Outliers are removed (OR) based on the relation exist between healthcare attributes and Mahalanobis distance respectively in the curated heart disease dataset (HDD). 

Use the procedure given in the article to arrive the curated data set from the mentioned publicly available dataset
