Authors : Rajkamal Rajendran, Anitha Karthi

<b> Highlights of this reseach work: <b>

A novel framework for heart disease detection is proposed. <br>
Handling categorical attributes based on its importance in health care and outcome. <br>
Covariance-based multivariate outlier detection is used for the outlier detection. <br>
Proposed Entropy-based FE (EFE) has performed well with ML models. <br>
The proposed ML pipeline outperformed the state of art works. <br>
